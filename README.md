# Dimensionality Reduction in Images

## Description

This project demonstrates techniques for dimensionality reduction applied to images. The script `converter.py` performs operations such as converting images to grayscale and reducing brightness, which can be useful for analysis or image preprocessing.

## Repository Structure

- `converter.py`: Main script that processes the images.
- `images/`: Folder containing example images.
  - `imagem.png`: Original image.
  - `imagem_cinza.jpg`: Grayscale version of the image.
  - `imagem_escura.jpg`: Darkened version of the image.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ka1ux/Reducao_de_Dimensionalidade_em_Imagens.git
cd Reducao_de_Dimensionalidade_em_Imagens
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

3. Run the `converter.py` script:

```bash
python converter.py
```

4. The processed images will be saved in the `images/` folder.
